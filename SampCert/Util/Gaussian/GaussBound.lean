# Gauss Bound

This file contains a proof that the sum of Gaussian terms with any mean (over the integers)
is bounded above by the sum of mean-zero Gaussian terms.

The argument transforms the series into a Fourier series, and eliminates the Fourier basis functions by
bounding them above by their absolute value. This has the effect of shifting the mean to zero; since
the sum of Fourier coefficients equals the sum of mean-zero Gaussian terms. The Poisson summation formula
justifies the transformation between series of ``gauss_term_ℝ ...`` and ``𝓕 (gauss_term_ℂ ...)``.
