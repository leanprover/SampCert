# SampCert

A verified implementation using [Lean](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) and [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) of randomized algorithms including [the discrete Gaussian sampler for differential privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00010) and key results in [zero concentrated differential privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02065).

SampCert is deployed and used in the [AWS Clean Rooms Differential Privacy service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/differential-privacy.html#dp-overview). SampCert proves deep properties about some of its randomized algorithm and makes heavy use of Mathlib. For example, we use theorems such as [the Poisson summation formula](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Analysis/Fourier/PoissonSummation.html#Real.tsum_eq_tsum_fourierIntegral_of_rpow_decay).

The principal developer of SampCert is [Jean-Baptiste Tristan](https://jtristan.github.io/). It is also developed by [Markus de Medeiros](https://www.markusde.ca/). 

Other people have contributed important ideas or tools for deployment including (in no particular order): Leo de Moura, Anjali Joshi, Joseph Tassarotti, Stefan Zetzsche, Aws Albharghouti, Muhammad Naveed, Tristan Ravitch.
